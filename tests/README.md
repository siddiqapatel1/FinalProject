# Test Suite Overview

This folder contains unit tests for the project, split into two logical categories:

1. **test_data_processing.py**
   - Tests related to data loading, merging, and validation.
   - Ensures critical columns exist in the dataset.
   - Validates that the dataset is properly prepared for visualisation.

2. **test_visualisations.py**
   - Tests related to visualisation generation and archival.
   - Checks that updated figures are generated successfully.
   - Verifies that old figures are archived and removed from the figures folder.

These tests ensure the project's critical stages are thoroughly validated.
