## Project Overview
This project examines the economic barriers to accessing healthy diets globally, focusing on disparities across income groups and regions. The analysis reveals significant challenges in diet affordability, particularly in low-income countries, and reinforces the need for targeted policy interventions to improve global food security and public health outcomes.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilises data from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP), specifically the 2021 dataset, which includes cost and affordability indicators for various diet quality levels:
- **Energy-sufficient diet**
- **Nutrient-adequate diet**
- **Healthy diet**

For more information on the ICP, visit the [World Bank's website](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp).

## Methodology
The study involves:
1. Grouping countries by income categories: low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income.
2. Calculating average costs for each diet type within these income groups.
3. Analysing the contribution of different food groups to the total cost of a healthy diet.
4. Assessing the affordability of diets by comparing costs to international poverty lines.

## Key Findings
- Approximately 35.6% of the global population (around 2.9 billion people) could not afford a healthy diet in 2021.
- In low-income countries, 70.89% of the population faces this challenge.
- Nutrient-dense foods, particularly animal-source products, vegetables, and fruits, significantly contribute to the cost of a healthy diet.
- High-income countries have the lowest rates of unaffordability for healthy diets (11.30%), reflecting greater economic access.
